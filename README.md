# UKC-Photo-Rater

This code takes thumbnail images scraped from the UK Climbing website (http://www.ukclimbing.com/photos/) which have been rated for photo quality by site users. These photos are used as training data to train neural networks to recognise good and bad images, using the Tensorflow package for Python.
