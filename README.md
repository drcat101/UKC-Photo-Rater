# Using convolutional neural networks to ? photo quality

## The data

This project came about because of idle speculation while out hiking: I take loads of photos, and it's often more time consuming to sort through them all at home than it is to take them in the first place. Maybe machine learning can help with this? Given the right data, can I make a model that will tell me which of my photos are better than the others?

I realized that I had come across some data that might work for this: on the British climbing website http://www.ukclimbing.com/ , users upload their climbing and mountaineering photos to share them with the climbing community. Other users can rate the photos from 1\* to 5\* and comment on them.



## The neural network architecture

## The results

This code takes thumbnail images scraped from the UK Climbing website (http://www.ukclimbing.com/photos/) which have been rated for photo quality by site users. These photos are used as training data to train neural networks to recognise good and bad images, using the Tensorflow package for Python.
